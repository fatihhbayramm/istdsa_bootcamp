# Car Prediction with WebScrapping and Linear Regression Model
This repository, which we created for our second project assignment within the scope of ISDSA- Data Science Bootcamp.
At Istanbul Data Science Academy, we are here with our second project assignment given to us to test our learning level and what we learned about web-scrapping in our Data Science Bootcamp. 
## The aim of this project: 
* To make solar energy price prediction with linear regression, which is one of the renewable energy sources with the information we scraped from the Web.
* To increase the success rate of our linear regression model with Feature Engineering.
