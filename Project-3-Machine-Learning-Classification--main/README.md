# Project 3: Machine Learning - Classification

### Scenario:

Build models for the purpose of classification problems using data obtained from the web, found yourself, or from one of the optionally available data sets. After creating the model, serve it as a simple web application to better showcase your work.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The data set to be worked on will be stored in the PostgreSQL database after the necessary operations are performed, and the data to be used in the notebooks we work on will be taken directly from the database.

# Stroke Prediction with Machine Learning

>This repository hosts a machine learning application for stroke prediction, leveraging advanced algorithms to assess patients' health status. 
>The model is trained on a dataset comprising patient records, including factors such as age, hypertension, heart disease history, glucose levels,  gender, smoking status, marital and work status, and residence type.
